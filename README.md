# kantu-json-to-py
kantu web automation json file to python output

# contribute
as much as i wish to program each single command to process a graceful python script, kantu is constantly under development which can prevent code that works today from working down the line. feel free to create a new branch with updates and i will push it here.

#usage
Modify `.json` file in `convert.py`

`python3 convert.py`
